java_wrapper
============

## This is a simple wrapper that will take java commands and convert any *NIX paths to windows paths for cygwin.

Before using this script be sure to set the `JAVA_CMD` variable in the java_wrapper.sh file to where java is installed.
More than likely, this will be: `/cygdrive/c/ProgramData/Oracle/Java/javapath/java`
